      <!-- What is a PRD? -->
      <h2>What Is a PRD?</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          A <strong>Product Requirements Document (PRD)</strong> is a structured document that
          describes <em>exactly</em> what a product should do, who it's for, and how it should
          behave. It acts as the single source of truth between the idea and the implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In traditional companies, PRDs are written by product managers and handed to engineering
          teams. With Lovable, the PRD is handed to an AI — which means precision matters even more,
          because the AI takes every word literally.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Why Lovable Relies on PRDs -->
      <h2>Why Lovable Relies on PRDs</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Lovable's AI interprets your instructions to generate code. The more structured and
          detailed your instructions, the more accurate the output. A PRD provides that structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a PRD, you end up in an endless loop of "fix this", "change that", "no, not like
          that". With a PRD, you get most of it right on the first pass.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box info">
          <p class="box-title">&#128218; Think of it this way</p>
          <p>
            A PRD is like a restaurant order. If you say "bring me food", you'll get something —
            but probably not what you wanted. If you say "grilled salmon, medium, with steamed
            vegetables and lemon butter sauce", you'll get exactly what you need.
          </p>

      <!-- Required PRD Sections -->
      <h2>Required PRD Sections</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>Every good PRD should include the following sections:</p>

        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Project Overview:</strong> A 2–3 sentence summary of what the app does and
            who it serves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> What pain point does this product address?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Target Users:</strong> Who will use this? Include personas if possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Core Features:</strong> A numbered list of must-have features for the MVP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Flows:</strong> Step-by-step descriptions of how a user moves through
            the app (e.g., sign up → dashboard → create project → log time).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pages &amp; Screens:</strong> List every page/screen with its elements and
            purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tech Requirements:</strong> Database schema, auth method, integrations, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design Guidelines:</strong> Colours, fonts, layout preferences, responsive
            requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Success Metrics:</strong> How will you measure if the product works?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Out of Scope:</strong> Explicitly list what you are NOT building. This is
            just as important as listing what you are building.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2>Bad PRD vs. Good PRD</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3>&#10060; Bad PRD</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Bad Example</span>
          <code>I want an online store. It should have products, a cart,
and checkout. Make it look modern.</code>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> No target audience. No specifics about products (categories?
          variants? images?). "Modern" is subjective. No mention of authentication, payments, or
          database structure.
        </p>

      <div class="highlight-box tip">
        <p class="box-title">&#9989; Pro Tip</p>
        <p>
          Keep your PRD in a separate document (Google Doc, Notion, or Markdown file). Reference
          it every time you write a new prompt for Lovable. Consistency comes from a single source
          of truth.

      <!-- Iterative Workflow -->
      <h2>The Iterative Workflow</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Building with Lovable is not a one-shot process. The best results come from an
          <strong>iterative workflow</strong>: build something, review it, identify issues, refine
          it, and repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          This cycle is faster with Lovable than traditional development — often minutes per
          iteration instead of hours — but the principle is the same. Each pass makes the product
          better.
        </p>

        <h3>The Iteration Cycle</h3>
        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> Send a clear, focused prompt to Lovable.</li>
          <li><strong>Review:</strong> Examine the generated output in the preview.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify:</strong> Note what's correct, what's wrong, and what's missing.</li>
          <li><strong>Refine:</strong> Send a follow-up prompt that addresses only the issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue until the feature meets your standards.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box info">
        <p class="box-title">&#128218; Why It Works</p>
        <p>
          Iteration works because each refinement prompt has more context (the AI can see what it
          already built). The AI gets smarter about your project with every exchange.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Feedback Loops -->
      <h2>Feedback Loops</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          A <strong>feedback loop</strong> is the process of observing output, forming a response,
          and feeding that response back into the system. In Lovable, there are three types:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Visual Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Look at the preview. Does the layout match your expectation? Are colours correct? Is
          spacing consistent? Are elements aligned?
        </p>

        <h3>2. Functional Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Click through the app. Do buttons work? Do forms validate? Does navigation route
          correctly? Do loading states appear?
        </p>

        <h3>3. Data Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Does the app fetch and display real data? Are database operations (create, read, update,
          delete) working? Are error states handled for empty or failed queries?
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box tip">
          <p class="box-title">&#128161; Tip</p>
          <p>
            Test on mobile view after every major change. Many issues (overflow, tiny text, broken
            grids) only appear on smaller screens. Lovable's preview has a mobile toggle — use it.

      <!-- Refinement Strategies -->
      <h2>Refinement Strategies</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3>Strategy 1: Surgical Prompts</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of re-describing the entire feature, target the specific problem:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Example</span>
          <code>❌ Bad: "Rebuild the product card to look better."

✅ Good: "On the product card component:
1. Increase image height from 200px to 280px
2. Add 8px border radius to the image
3. Change price colour to #16a34a (green)
4. Add a subtle hover shadow (shadow-lg on hover)"</code>
        </div>

        <h3>Strategy 2: Reference the Existing Output</h3>
        <p>
          Tell the AI what's already correct so it doesn't break working parts:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Example</span>
          <code>"The product list page layout is correct.
Do NOT change the grid or card structure.
Only add a 'Sort by Price' dropdown above the grid
that sorts products ascending/descending."</code>
        </div>

        <h3>Strategy 3: Fix One Thing at a Time</h3>
        <p>
          If you found 5 issues, send 5 focused prompts — not one massive one. This gives the AI
          clear context for each fix and reduces the chance of introducing new bugs.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategy 4: Use "Keep / Change / Remove" Format</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Example</span>
          <code>On the checkout page:

KEEP:
- The form layout (shipping address fields)
- The order summary sidebar

CHANGE:
- Submit button colour from grey to purple (#7c3aed)
- Add form validation messages below each field

REMOVE:
- The "Apply Coupon" section (not needed for MVP)</code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Example: Improving UI -->
      <h2>Example: Improving UI</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3>Initial Output (after first prompt)</h3>
        <p>
          The AI generated a product list page. The layout works, but the cards look flat, spacing
          is too tight, and there's no hover effect.
        </p>

        <h3>Refinement Prompt</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Prompt</span>
          <code>"Improve the product list page visuals:
1. Add shadow-md to each product card
2. Add 16px gap between cards (currently too tight)
3. On hover: scale card to 1.02 and increase shadow to shadow-lg
4. Add a subtle border (1px solid #e2e8f0) to each card
5. Round card corners to 12px
6. Add a fade-in animation when cards load (300ms ease)"</code>
        </div>

        <p>Result: The AI updates only the visual properties without breaking layout or data.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Example: Fixing Logic -->
      <h2>Example: Fixing Logic</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3>Bug Found</h3>
        <p>
          The cart allows adding the same item multiple times as separate entries instead of
          incrementing the quantity.
        </p>

        <h3>Fix Prompt</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Prompt</span>
          <code>"Fix the cart logic:
When a user adds a product that is already in the cart,
do NOT add a new entry. Instead, find the existing entry
by product ID and increment its quantity by 1.
Show a toast notification: 'Quantity updated' instead
of 'Added to cart' when incrementing."</code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Example: Enhancing UX -->
      <h2>Example: Enhancing UX</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>
          The app works but feels static. There's no feedback when actions happen, and loading
          states are missing.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhancement Prompt</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Prompt</span>
          <code>"Enhance UX across the app:
1. Add skeleton loaders to all pages that fetch data
   (replace the empty white screen while loading)
2. Add toast notifications for all user actions:
   - 'Added to cart' (success, green)
   - 'Removed from cart' (info, blue)
   - 'Order placed!' (success, green)
   - 'Error: please try again' (error, red)
3. Add loading spinner inside submit buttons while
   async operations are in progress
4. Disable submit buttons during loading to prevent
   double-clicks"</code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box warning">
        <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Common Pitfall</p>
        <p>
          Don't iterate endlessly on small visual tweaks. Set a "good enough" bar for your MVP.
          You can always polish later. The goal of iteration is finding and fixing <em>real
          problems</em>, not achieving pixel-perfection on day one.

      <!-- Hosting Model -->
      <h2>Hosting Model</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Lovable Cloud is the built-in hosting infrastructure that powers your apps. When you
          build something in Lovable, it's not just a preview — it's a real, deployed web
          application running on Lovable's cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's how it works under the hood:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Static assets</strong> (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are served via a global CDN
            for fast delivery anywhere in the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Server-side logic</strong> (if any) runs through Supabase Edge Functions —
            serverless functions deployed at the edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database &amp; Auth</strong> are handled by Supabase PostgreSQL, with
            automatic connection pooling and Row Level Security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SSL certificates</strong> are provisioned automatically. Every deployed app
            gets HTTPS out of the box.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box info">
          <p class="box-title">&#128218; What This Means for You</p>
          <p>
            You never need to configure a server, set up NGINX, manage SSL, or worry about
            scaling. Lovable Cloud handles all of that. You focus on the product; the platform
            handles the infrastructure.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Environments -->
      <h2>Environments</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Professional software development uses <strong>environments</strong> to separate
          different stages of your app. Lovable Cloud supports this pattern:
        </p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Environment</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
              <th>Who Uses It</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Preview</strong></td>
              <td>Live preview during development. Updated with every prompt.</td>
              <td>You (the builder)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Staging</strong></td>
              <td>A test environment for QA before going live.</td>
              <td>You + testers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Production</strong></td>
              <td>The live version that real users access.</td>
              <td>Everyone (public)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Why Environments Matter</h3>
        <p>
          Without environments, every change you make is immediately visible to users. This is
          dangerous — a broken prompt could take down your live app. Environments let you test
          changes safely before pushing them to production.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box tip">
          <p class="box-title">&#128161; Best Practice</p>
          <p>
            Always test new features in the preview environment first. Only promote to production
            when you've verified everything works correctly.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Deployment Flow -->
      <h2>Deployment Flow</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Deploying with Lovable Cloud follows a simple, predictable flow:
        </p>

        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Build in Lovable:</strong> Use prompts and Visual Mode to create or update
            your app. Every change is automatically reflected in the preview.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Test in Preview:</strong> Click through your app in the preview panel. Test
            all features, forms, navigation, and edge cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deploy to Staging:</strong> When satisfied, click "Deploy" and select the
            staging environment. Share the staging URL with testers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>QA &amp; Feedback:</strong> Testers verify functionality. Collect feedback
            and address any issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promote to Production:</strong> Once approved, promote the staging build to
            production. Your live URL is updated instantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor:</strong> After deployment, check for errors, performance issues, or
            user-reported bugs. Roll back if needed.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <!-- Version Control -->
      <h2>Version Control</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Version control means keeping a history of every change made to your project. Lovable
          provides built-in version control so you can:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>See change history:</strong> Every prompt you send creates a new version snapshot.</li>
          <li><strong>Roll back:</strong> If a change breaks something, restore a previous working version.</li>
          <li><strong>Compare versions:</strong> See what changed between any two snapshots.</li>
          <li><strong>Branch (via GitHub):</strong> Lovable integrates with GitHub. You can push your code to a repository and use standard Git workflows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lovable + GitHub Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Lovable can sync your project with a GitHub repository. This gives you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full Git history with commits for each change</li>
          <li>Ability to clone the repo and work locally</li>
          <li>Pull requests and code reviews if you have a team</li>
          <li>CI/CD pipeline integration if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Example Git Flow</span>
          <code>  Lovable generates code
        ↓
  Auto-commit to GitHub (main branch)
        ↓
  You can create feature branches locally
        ↓
  Merge back to main
        ↓
  Lovable syncs with latest main</code>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box warning">
          <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Important</p>
          <p>
            If you make changes in GitHub directly (outside Lovable), make sure to sync before
            building more in Lovable to avoid conflicts.

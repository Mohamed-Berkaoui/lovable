      <!-- ---------- What is Lovable? ---------- -->
      <h2>What Is Lovable?</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Lovable</strong> is a next-generation, AI-powered application builder. It allows anyone — from
          complete beginners to senior engineers — to describe an application in plain English and receive a
          fully functional, deployable web app in return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it as having a senior full-stack developer on your team that never sleeps, never
          complains, and builds at the speed of thought. You describe <em>what</em> you want; Lovable
          figures out <em>how</em> to build it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood, Lovable uses large language models (LLMs) combined with a curated tech stack
          (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and more) to generate production-grade code. But you
          never have to touch that code unless you want to.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- ---------- Who Should Use It? ---------- -->
      <h2>Who Should Use Lovable?</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3>1. Non-Technical Founders</h3>
        <p>
          You have a startup idea but no engineering team. Lovable lets you build a working MVP in hours
          instead of months. You can validate your idea with real users before investing in a full
          development team.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Designers Who Want to Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of static mockups in Figma, you can create a <em>living, breathing</em> prototype that
          people can actually click through — with real data, real navigation, and real interactions.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Developers Who Want to Move Faster</h3>
        <p>
          Even experienced engineers use Lovable to skip the boilerplate. Why spend two hours setting up
          auth, routing, and layout when Lovable can do it in two minutes?
        </p>

        <h3>4. Product Managers</h3>
        <p>
          Need to demonstrate a feature to stakeholders? Build a working demo instead of a slide deck.
          Lovable turns your product requirements into a real interface almost instantly.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Educators &amp; Students</h3>
        <p>
          Learning to code? Lovable lets you see how professional applications are structured. You can
          read the generated code, understand patterns, and learn by example.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- ---------- Typical Use Cases ---------- -->
      <h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MVP / Proof of Concept:</strong> Quickly validate an idea with a working product.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal Tools:</strong> Build admin dashboards, CRM panels, or inventory trackers for your team.</li>
          <li><strong>Landing Pages:</strong> Create marketing pages with forms, animations, and responsive layouts.</li>
          <li><strong>SaaS Prototypes:</strong> Generate multi-page apps with auth, database, and payment integrations.</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio Projects:</strong> Students and freelancers can build impressive projects quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Hackathons:</strong> Go from idea to deployed app within a single hackathon sprint.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- ---------- How it Changes Development ---------- -->
      <h2>How Lovable Changes Traditional Development</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Traditional development follows a predictable but slow pipeline: idea → wireframe → design →
          frontend → backend → testing → deployment. Each stage can take days or weeks and requires
          specialised skill sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lovable compresses this entire pipeline into a <strong>conversation</strong>. You describe
          what you need, and the AI generates the design, writes the code, connects the database, and
          deploys — all in one flow.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box tip">
          <p class="box-title">&#128161; Key Insight</p>
          <p>
            Lovable doesn't replace developers — it amplifies them. A single developer using Lovable
            can accomplish what previously required a team of five.
          </p>

        <p class="box-title">&#9989; Tip</p>
        <p>
          Before you start building, take 15 minutes to clearly define <em>what</em> you want your
          app to do. The clearer your input, the better Lovable's output. We'll cover this in the
          <strong>Project Preparation</strong> section.

      <div class="highlight-box warning">
        <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Warning</p>
        <p>
          Lovable is powerful, but it is not magic. It follows your instructions literally. If your
          prompt is vague, the result will be vague. Always be specific and structured.

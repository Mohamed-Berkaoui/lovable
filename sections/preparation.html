      <!-- Why Preparation Matters -->
      <h2>Why Preparation Matters</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Imagine building a house without a blueprint. You might start with the walls, realise the
          door is in the wrong place, tear it down, and start over. Software works exactly the same
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Preparation reduces waste.</strong> When you invest time upfront to clarify your
          goals, understand your users, and define success metrics, every minute of building time
          that follows becomes dramatically more productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is especially true with Lovable. Because the AI builds so quickly, a vague prompt
          can produce a fully built — but completely wrong — application in minutes. Preparation
          ensures you build the <em>right thing</em>, not just <em>a thing</em>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box info">
        <p class="box-title">&#128218; Remember</p>
        <p>
          "Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning." — an old engineering proverb that is
          even more relevant in the age of AI.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Understanding the Problem -->
      <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          Before you think about features, screens, or technology, ask yourself one question:
          <strong>"What problem am I solving?"</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Write down the answer in one or two sentences. If you can't, you're not ready to build yet.</p>

        <h3>Problem Statement Template</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Template</span>
          <code>[Target users] need a way to [action/goal]
because [reason/pain point].
Currently, they [current workaround],
which is [why it's inadequate].</code>
        </div>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Example</span>
          <code>Freelance designers need a way to track project hours
because they bill clients by the hour.
Currently, they use spreadsheets,
which are error-prone and lack automation.</code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- User Personas -->
      <h2>Defining User Personas</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          A <strong>user persona</strong> is a fictional but realistic description of one type of
          person who will use your app. Personas keep your design decisions grounded in reality
          instead of assumptions.
        </p>

        <h3>What to Include in a Persona</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name &amp; role:</strong> "Sarah, 32, freelance graphic designer"</li>
          <li><strong>Goals:</strong> What do they want to achieve?</li>
          <li><strong>Pain points:</strong> What frustrates them today?</li>
          <li><strong>Tech comfort:</strong> Are they tech-savvy or beginners?</li>
          <li><strong>Context:</strong> When and where will they use your app?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example Persona</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
          <span class="code-label">Persona</span>
          <code>Name: Sarah
Role: Freelance graphic designer
Age: 32
Goals: Track hours per project, generate invoices
Pain Points: Spreadsheets are slow, forgets to log time
Tech Comfort: Medium — uses Figma, Notion, Slack
Context: Works from home, uses laptop + phone</code>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box tip">
          <p class="box-title">&#128161; Tip</p>
          <p>
            Create 2–3 personas maximum. More than that and you'll lose focus. Your MVP should
            serve your <em>primary</em> persona extremely well.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Success Metrics -->
      <h2>Defining Success Metrics</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <p>
          How will you know if your app is successful? Without metrics, you're guessing. Define
          measurable goals <strong>before</strong> you start building.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Metrics</h3>
        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric Type</th>
              <th>Example</th>
              <th>When to Use</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Acquisition</td>
              <td>100 sign-ups in first week</td>
              <td>Validating demand</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Activation</td>
              <td>60% complete onboarding</td>
              <td>Measuring first experience</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Retention</td>
              <td>40% return within 7 days</td>
              <td>Testing stickiness</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Revenue</td>
              <td>10 paid conversions/month</td>
              <td>Business viability</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Task Completion</td>
              <td>User logs time in &lt; 30 sec</td>
              <td>UX quality</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

      <!-- Common Mistakes -->
      <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

      <div class="content-card">
        <div class="highlight-box warning">
          <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Mistake 1: Skipping research</p>
          <p>
            Building without talking to real potential users. Your assumptions about what people
            need are almost always wrong. Talk to at least 5 people before building anything.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box warning">
          <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Mistake 2: Feature overload</p>
          <p>
            Trying to build everything at once. Your MVP should have 3–5 core features, not 30.
            If you can't describe your app in one sentence, it's too complex.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box warning">
          <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Mistake 3: Vague goals</p>
          <p>
            "I want to build something cool" is not a goal. "I want freelancers to track billable
            hours in under 30 seconds" is a goal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box warning">
          <p class="box-title">&#9888;&#65039; Mistake 4: Ignoring the competition</p>
          <p>
            If similar tools exist, study them. What do they do well? What do they do poorly?
            Your app should clearly improve on at least one dimension.
          </p>

          <li>

          <li>
            <strong>Identify primary persona:</strong> Sarah, 32, freelance designer, works from

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set success metrics:</strong> 50 sign-ups in week 1, 60% complete onboarding,
            average time-log action under 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>List core features (MVP):</strong> Start/stop timer, manual time entry, project
            categorisation, weekly summary export.

          <li>
            <strong>List "nice-to-have" features (post-MVP):</strong> Invoice generation, client
            portal, integrations with Stripe/Notion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write the problem statement:</strong> "Freelance designers need a way to track
